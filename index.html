        It was a dark, dreary night, nearing the middle of October.  A man on a mission decided it was time to take a stab at serving static, whimsical content to ease your attention...
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="Sarcasm">
        Yeah, so much for that...  let's start over.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm Lee Gurley, and I'm a C# .NET developer for <b>pasUNITY ®</b>.
        I don't know if it's weird that I remember the copyright key combination is alt-0-1-7-4, but I'll go with it.
        I have been developing on the .NET framework for 4 years now, and what a blast it has been.  I've done
        <a class="Sarcasm" href="https://github.com/LeeIsMe77" target="_blank" title="Not">all kinds of cool things</a>, 
        such as creating a <a href="https://github.com/LeeIsMe77/CSMudClient">C# Mud Client</a> (that barely works and is missing a bazillion features),
        creating <a href="https://github.com/LeeIsMe77/RotS.Addon">C# COM add-ins (and bots)</a> for JMC Mud Client,
        creating a <a href="https://github.com/LeeIsMe77/SimpleRCD">C# class designer</a> for the MUD that the previous two projects were targeted,
        and lastly, a <a href="https://github.com/LeeIsMe77/VideoScraper">video scraper</a>, that doesn't quite fit into this whole section!
      </p>
      <p>
        On a more serious note, I have done some AWESOME things, and I'm just not able to share them with you on GitHub.  
        Feel free to check out <a href="https://www.pasunity.com">pasUNITY®</a> (note the alt-0-7-4 again) website to see what we're all about, and know that I'm going to be around for a while.
        I have vivid plans on becoming active in the open-source community, with my current desires set on some really neat fantasy-football predicting apps so I can stop losing so much money <span class="Sarcasm">HAH</span>.
        We all have our faults... some of us MANY more than others.  I fall into the others category.  Don't judge.  Mind you, this static content I was looking forward to serve up also falls into the others category...
        Look, I'm not a web developer.  Or at least not a designer.  But I'm working on it, and that's what the point of this site has become.  Don't judge.
